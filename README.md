# ethminer-discord-bot
A discord bot that interfaces with the ethminer API. Will require a fair bit of setup. Don't forget to put in your bot key.

# Features:
- Sends a message to a predetermined channel on reboot (useful to know when a power outage happens and you need to reapply overclocks)
- Replies to "ping" with data
- Remote shutdown with "reboot" and "force reboot"
- Replies to "screenshot" with a screenshot
- Checks with pool API every 10 minutes to see hashrate. If hashrate lower than limit 3 times in a row, reboot
